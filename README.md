This program creates a dynamic car parking system where the user can define the size of the parking area using rows and columns. It uses a menu-driven approach to allow users to park vehicles, remove parked vehicles, display the current parking layout, and search for vehicles easily. Each vehicle is tracked using its license plate number stored in a dictionary, which helps in efficiently managing parking locations and retrieving vehicle details quickly.
